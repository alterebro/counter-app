> Javascript Demo WebApp built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

This is just a counter web application, that simply count things, it doesn't do anything else. It lets you create multiple counters and stores the countings in the local storage of the client device. It also can import and export the application data.
