# [counter-app](https://counter-webapp.netlify.app/)

> Javascript Demo Cross platform Progressive Web Application built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Available online as a PWA deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and as a native Android App compiled using the [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) build tool.

This is just a counter application, that simply count things, it doesn't do anything else. It lets you create multiple counters and stores the countings in the local storage of the client device. It also can import and export the application data.

Example of a Vue app converted into a Progressive Web Application that can be published on the Google Play Store. The PWA now can be installed on the android device as a WebApp through the website or as a native application through the Play Store.
